            <img src="me.jpg" class="me">
            <p>I'm a 29 year old woman named Hyst Busuttil who is constantly annoyed by her legal name which
                 has yet to be changed.</p>
            <p>I work full time as a contracter for the Australian Taxation Office,
                working for Probe Group. I provide tech support to ATO customers who call in.</p>
            <p>I enjoy many games, and currently am replaying RimWorld and trying out Risk of Rain 2.</p>
            <p>In addition to my videogame hobby, I am quite passionate about becoming a programmer.
                this is reflected positively in my work, for example taking all this effort to create a somewhat professional, if outdated, looking first presentation task.</p>
            <p>I look forward this trimester to learning Vue.js and further polishing my HTML and CSS skills alongside The Odin Project.</p>
